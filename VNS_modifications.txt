VNS (Variable Neighborhood Search)

Note: The first commit is based on "VNS_v1_1604"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*VNS_v1_1602: (version of 2016, month 02)
	Features:
	- Parameters can be read from the command line.
	- Genomes and genes can be read from a file.
	- The initial phylogenetic tree can be built: randomly, 
	  or using heuristic of 1st best score.
	- VNS uses the following neighborhoods: random NNI for Subtrees,
	  random Single Step, random SPR, random TBR.  
	- This version supports the following distances: 
	  reversal distance, and breakpoint distance.
	- Median solvers for reversals and breakpoints were 
	  taken from GRAPPA.
	- Refinements functions were implemented after VNS: 
	  "exhaustiveSubTreeScramble(..)" and "exhaustiveSwap(...)" 
	- Three different optimizers were implemented: Blanchette, 
	  Kovac, Kovac_Modified, and Median_Candidate.

*VNS_v1_1603 (version of 2016, month 03)
	Features of last version(1602) were inherited.
	
	New Features:
	- Permutations(genomes) can be condensed, that is can be packed, 
	  reducing their number of blocks. Also, after performing 
	  operations over the condensed permutations, it can be 
	  unpacked (decode).
	
	Modified Functions:
	- main.c: the functions "readNumberGenomes(...)" and 
	  "readNumberGenes(...)" were extended for cases when last char 
	  before EOF is different from '\n'.
	- tree.c: the function "readGenomes(...)" by the same reason above.	
	- main.c: the function ""readNumberGenomes(...)" was modified
	  to exit the program when the number of genomes is <=3
	- the name of file basic_vns.c (.h) was changed to vns.c (.h)
	- the function "basicVNS(...)" was changed to "VNS(...)"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*VNS_v1_1604 (version of 2016, month 04)
	Features of last version(1603) were inherited.

	New Features:

	Modifications:
	- main.c: the function "readNumberGenes(...)" was modified in 
	  order to read multi-chromosomes genomes. Also, this fucntion
	  verifies that the last symbol is @ or $.
	- tree.c: the function "readGenomes(...)" was modified for 
	  reading just uni-chromosomes (all circular or all linear). 
	  We use this function when working with the reversal distance.
	- tree.c: a new function was created "readGenomesDCJ(...)". This
	  function is used when working with DCJ distances, also, this
	  function support reading multi-chromosomes.
	- dcjdist.c: the function "DCJdistance" was created. This function
	  is used for calculating the DCJ distance.
	- dcjdist.c: the function "applyDCJ" was created. This function 
	  is used for applying a DCJ operation.
	- iterate_tree.c: the function "labelOptimizeTree_KovacModifiedDCJ" 
	  this function is used to improve (and label) the score of a tree.
	- iterate_tree.c: the function "scoreTree" was modified in order
	  to support the score of a tree using the DCJ distance.
